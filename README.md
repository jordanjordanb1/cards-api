# Cards API

This was created for a interview test project. But, I have been wanting to learn Go for awhile now, but have been putting it off. So, this was a great way for me to start.

## How to run

> Note: This assumes that you have Go installed. (https://golang.org/doc/install)

> Note: Project was built using Go v1.16. I cannot guarentee compatability with older versions as I am still learning Go.

1. Clone repo.
2. Move into cloned directory.
3. Run `./build.sh` followed by `./start.sh`
4. API will be accessible by default at `localhost:8080/api`

For development, simply run: `go run main.go`

## Running tests

1. Run `./tests.sh`
